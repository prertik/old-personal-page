      <description>Hello Everyone.
This is week was awesome. The patch I&amp;rsquo;m working on hit a milestone. Now, it can perform a real rebase. Of course, the environment variables are kept default and this might introduce bugs but for development purposes; to see real development, this is one amazing way. There was also some work on refactoring out codes from sequencer.c to checkout.c so that the codes can be used from our builtin rebase.</description>

      <description>A week ago I had promised an hour and a half of every friday to teach some interested kids about computers who are currently studying in a Government run school. This idea of contributing to teach others was proposed to be my a genuine social worker Suraj Karki.
Here are my findings on the first day:
 There are three types of school found in Nepal, i) International school: funded and run by foreigners, ii) Boarding schools: funded by local people or some organization and iii) Government school: funded and run by the Government.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone.
This week there was lots of progress in builtin rebase. Lots of thanks to Johannes Schindelin, without him the patch wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in current state. Rather than work on emulating smaller functions from git-rebase.sh like I explained previously in my blog post. Me and Dscho went a lot farther and implemented a super simple rebase. You can find the code here. If you&amp;rsquo;re feeling adventurous get the code and run some rebase tasks.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone.
Hope all of you readers had a great weekend. This week I worked on emulating run_specific_rebase () which is in git-rebase.sh. Firstly, I have tried to emulate specifically, this shell script:
. git-rebase--$type git_rebase__$type${preserve_merges:+__preserve_merges}  The work in progress patch of this conversion can be found here. The patch isn&amp;rsquo;t ready as apply_autostash() function need some extra working. To make it working slight modifications to sequencer.c is required which will be done in the coming days.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
This week I have been working on migrating small shell scripting component to C builtin. The work will be towards parsing a small modular component so that it can directly be used. With the development of my current patch, the rebase built-in that I will work on can do a super simple rebase.
I might be able to demonstrate something in 2-3 days.
That&amp;rsquo;s a wrap up for this week.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
Sorry for the late blog. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t more action on week 03 and there was some action on week 04 *finally*. So, I had to merge both.
Oh and a note to the readers, the previously assured Part II of Git Rebase will take some time as I plan to explain you the workings from the rebase builtin I will create. :-)
So, during these two weeks, a skeletal for rebase builtin was created.</description>

      <description>Ok, you&amp;rsquo;ve read my previous Git blog. There were nice feedback in the mailing list and in emails and IRC. This week I did a close study on git-rebase. There are _a_lot_of_posts_ about git-rebase which talk of benefits of rebase and some are negative towards rebase. By convention, it is understood that rebase is harder to understand for beginners that&amp;rsquo;s why most will prefer merging. Even Github has merging of pull requests by default and to do rebase and merge you&amp;rsquo;ll have to select it from the drop-down menu in the pull-requests section.</description>

      <description>This summer of &amp;lsquo;18, I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in Git. Git is an insanely awesome software. I still remember the day I learned about Git via Github and instantly got hooked. Git isn&amp;rsquo;t just an everyday software you encounter, just look at the documentation and observe closely how it works and you will understand the rock solid design. Enough with Git introduction already. There are too much posts describing Git already.</description>

      <description>Hi folks, I am Pratik Karki known around the internet as prertik. I do good programming but mostly I do bad programming. Read my blog to know how not to do programming like me and become better programmer. There&amp;rsquo;s a saying in Chinese about this but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand the words and can&amp;rsquo;t search it over the internet.
tl;dr I am bad developer.
