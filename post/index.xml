      <title>Week 05 Progress</title>

      <description>Hello everyone,
This week I have been working on migrating small shell scripting component to C builtin. The work will be towards parsing a small modular component so that it can directly be used. With the development of my current patch, the rebase built-in that I will work on can do a super simple rebase.
I might be able to demonstrate something in 2-3 days.
That&amp;rsquo;s a wrap up for this week.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
Sorry for the late blog. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t more action on week 03 and there was some action on week 04 *finally*. So, I had to merge both.
Oh and a note to the readers, the previously assured Part II of Git Rebase will take some time as I plan to explain you the workings from the rebase builtin I will create. :-)
So, during these two weeks, a skeletal for rebase builtin was created.</description>

      <title>Git InsideÂ® Part I: Don&#39;t Fear the Rebase</title>

      <description>Ok, you&amp;rsquo;ve read my previous Git blog. There were nice feedback in the mailing list and in emails and IRC. This week I did a close study on git-rebase. There are _a_lot_of_posts_ about git-rebase which talk of benefits of rebase and some are negative towards rebase. By convention, it is understood that rebase is harder to understand for beginners that&amp;rsquo;s why most will prefer merging. Even Github has merging of pull requests by default and to do rebase and merge you&amp;rsquo;ll have to select it from the drop-down menu in the pull-requests section.</description>

      <title>Git: An Unexpected Journey</title>

      <description>This summer of &amp;lsquo;18, I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in Git. Git is an insanely awesome software. I still remember the day I learned about Git via Github and instantly got hooked. Git isn&amp;rsquo;t just an everyday software you encounter, just look at the documentation and observe closely how it works and you will understand the rock solid design. Enough with Git introduction already. There are too much posts describing Git already.</description>
